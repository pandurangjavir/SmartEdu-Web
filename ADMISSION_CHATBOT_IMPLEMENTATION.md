## Supported Queries

The chatbot responds to admission-related queries using the backend's `get_college_info_response` function:

- **Admission queries**: "How can I apply for admission?"
- **Fee queries**: "What is the fee structure?"
- **Cutoff queries**: "What is the cutoff for CSE?"
- **Hostel queries**: "What is the hostel fee?"
- **Transport queries**: "Does the college have transport?"

## User Experience

1. **Chat Button**: Circular blue button with chat icon in bottom-right
2. **Chat Window**: 
   - Opens when button is clicked
   - Gradient blue header with "SmartEdu Assistant"
   - Scrollable message area
   - Input field at bottom with send button
3. **Messages**:
   - User messages: Blue background, right-aligned
   - Bot messages: Gray background, left-aligned

## Integration with Backend

The chatbot sends POST requests to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot
```

With payload:
```json
{
  "message": "user's question",
  "user_id": 0  // Guest user
}
```

The backend routes admission-related queries to the appropriate handlers in `get_college_info_response` function.
