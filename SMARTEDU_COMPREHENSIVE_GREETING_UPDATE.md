3. Who are you (ask_whoareyou)

8. Other intents (fee_query, attendance_query, etc.)

#### Context-Aware Greetings
The greet intent includes sophisticated context detection:
- **Polite greetings**: Time-aware responses (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **Friendly greetings**: Casual responses with personality
- **Introductory greetings**: Identity and purpose explanation
- **Return greetings**: Welcoming back users
- **Checking availability**: Confirming online status
